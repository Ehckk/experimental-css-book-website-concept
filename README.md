### What is this?
- This is an experimental website concept I came up with after messing around with 3D CSS transforms
- The idea is it's a closed book, then (possibly after the user is authenticated), the book opens, and inside of the book is your traditional website
- Yes it's all CSS except for the buttons because rendering 3D shapes and animations is no problem at all for CSS but as soon as you need basic data binding you're out of luck
- It is somewhat janky at times, and I've tried my best to optimise it as much as I can (reducing render size, avoiding repaints, etc)
- But ultimately there's only so much you can do with a coding language that is used to color text boxes
- Don't even try to open it on a mobile device. It's purely experimental and proof-of-concept. 

### How to view
- Download the code
- Made sure you have Node.js/NPM installed 
- Open the directiory in a terminal/IDE
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Then run `npm run dev` to run the program
- Open you browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
